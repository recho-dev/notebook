 * > We want to live in the editor forever. â€” Luyu Cheng[1]
 *
 * Recho Notebook[2] is a free, open-source, reactive editor for algorithms
 * and ASCII art. It introduces a plain code format for notebooks â€” echoing
 * output inline as comments for live, in-situ coding with instant feedback.
 * Built on vanilla JavaScript and the reactive model of Observable Notebook
 * Kit[3], Recho Notebook lets developers, artists, and learners explore and
 * create directly in code.
 *
 * Here is a word counting example to show the core feature of Recho Notebook:
 * echoing output inline as comments. By calling `echo(results)`, the results
 * are displayed as comments above the statement! Now we can better understand
 * this piece of code by better "seeing" every manipulation. Notice that there
 * is no need to switch to console to see the results, which results in an
 * in-situ experience. And of course, we can be a little creative at last:
 * writing a few lines of code to create a simple visualization!
